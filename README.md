# VertTracker
A side project intended to measure vertical jump using an iPhone's built-in altimeter

## Note
Due to the Altimeter hardware being limited to refreshing at 1Hz, the vertical displacement data does not update fast enough to measure a vertical jump. Developers' forums on Apple indicate no parameters to modify the data update rate.

## How to use

1. Press and hold the large circle button with the action figure.
2. Jump and ensure the device is held in the same place so that the relative vertical displacement can be measured
3. Let go of the button
